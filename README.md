# Cookie Consent Prank

A tongue-in-cheek cookie/privacy modal that “loves your data.” It pops up after a short delay, asks for a name and email, and walks users through a fake data upload/sale sequence before letting them close the dialog. Perfect as a small DOM/JavaScript practice demo.

## What’s Inside
- HTML layout with the main “learning to code” pitch plus a modal dialog.
- CSS for the card layout, modal styling, and playful color accents.
- Vanilla JavaScript to handle the popup timer, close/decline behavior, form submission, and staged loading text.
- Lightweight assets in `images/` (`bugatti.jpg`, `loading.svg`, `pirate.gif`).

## How It Works
1) After ~1.5s the modal appears and disables the close button.
2) Hovering “Decline” flips the button order for a small prank effect.
3) Submitting the form swaps the modal content into a two-step fake “upload/sale” animation and finally thanks the user by name.
4) The close button is re-enabled once the sequence finishes.

## Getting Started
- Open `index.html` directly in a browser—no build tooling required.
- Edit `index.js` or `index.css` to change timings, copy, or styles.

## Tech Stack
- HTML + CSS + vanilla JavaScript

## Notes
- Inputs are required but no data is sent anywhere; this is a front-end-only parody.
